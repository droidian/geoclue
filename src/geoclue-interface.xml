      org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Manager:
      @short_description: The GeoClue service manager

      This is the interface you use to talk to main GeoClue2 manager object at
      path "/org/freedesktop/GeoClue2/Manager". The only thing you do with this
      interface is to call org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Manager.GetClient() on it
      to get your application specific client object.

  <interface name="org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Manager">

    <!--
        GetClient:
        @client: The path for newly created client object

        Retrieves a client object which can only be used by the calling
        application only.

      org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Client:
      @short_description: The Application-specific client API

      This is the interface you use to retrieve location information and receive
      location update signals from GeoClue service. You get the client object to
      use this interface on from org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Manager.GetClient()
      method.

        Location:

        Current location as path to a #org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Location object.

    <!--
        DistanceThreshold:

        Contains the current distance threshold in meters. This value is used
        by the service when it gets new location info. If the distance moved is
        below the threshold, it won't emit the LocationUpdated signal.

        Start:

        Start receiving events about the current location. Applications should
        hook-up to #org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Client::LocationUpdated signal
        before calling this method.

        Stop:

        Stop receiving events about the current location.

        @old: old location as path to a #org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Location object
        @new: new location as path to a #org.freedesktop.GeoClue2.Location object

        The signal is emitted every time the location changes.

        often this signal is emitted.

        Description:

        A human-readable description of the location, if available.

        WARNING: Applications should not rely on this property since not all
        sources provide a description. If you really need a description (or
        more details) about current location, use a reverse-geocoding API, e.g
        geocode-glib.
